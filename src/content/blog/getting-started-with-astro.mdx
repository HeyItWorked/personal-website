I've been meaning to rebuild my personal website for a while now. After trying out various frameworks and static site generators, I finally settled on [Astro](https://astro.dev) - and I couldn't be happier with the choice.

## Why Astro?

Astro brings a few things to the table that really resonated with me:

### Zero JavaScript by Default

This was the big selling point. Astro ships zero JavaScript to the browser by default. For a content-heavy site like a personal website, this means incredibly fast load times. The static HTML is sent to the browser, and only interactive components get hydrated with JavaScript.

### Islands Architecture

When you do need interactivity, Astro's islands architecture lets you sprinkle in JavaScript only where needed. A theme toggle? That gets hydrated. A contact form? Hydrated. The rest of your content? Pure, fast HTML.

### Framework Agnostic

Want to use React components? Vue? Svelte? Astro doesn't care. You can mix and match frameworks, or use none at all. For this site, I stuck with Astro components and a bit of vanilla JavaScript - keeping things simple.

## The Tech Stack

Here's what I'm using for this site:

- **Astro** - The core framework
- **Tailwind CSS** - Utility-first styling
- **MDX** - Writing content with JSX support
- **TypeScript** - Type safety throughout
- **Bun** - Fast package manager and runtime

## Getting Started

Setting up an Astro project is straightforward:

```bash
bun create astro@latest my-site
cd my-site
bunx astro add tailwind mdx
```

The CLI walks you through the setup, and you're up and running in minutes.

## Content Collections

One of my favorite Astro features is content collections. Define a schema for your content, and Astro gives you:

- TypeScript types for your frontmatter
- Automatic slug generation
- Easy querying with `getCollection()`

Here's my blog post schema:

```typescript
const blogCollection = defineCollection({
  type: 'content',
  schema: z.object({
    title: z.string(),
    description: z.string(),
    pubDate: z.date(),
    tags: z.array(z.string()),
    draft: z.boolean().default(false),
  }),
});
```

## Deployment

Astro builds to static HTML, which means you can deploy anywhere:

- Vercel
- Netlify
- Cloudflare Pages
- GitHub Pages
- Any static host

I'm using Cloudflare Pages for the global CDN and excellent performance.

## Final Thoughts

Astro strikes a great balance between developer experience and user experience. The build process is fast, the output is optimized, and the developer ergonomics are excellent.

If you're building a content-focused website and care about performance, give Astro a try. You might just fall in love with it too.
