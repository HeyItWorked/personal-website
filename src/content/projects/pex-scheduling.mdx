## Project Overview

A hackathon project focused on optimizing patient scheduling through data-driven approaches. Conducted comprehensive data reconciliation and prototyped a weighted scoring framework to enable AI-driven scheduling recommendations.

## Key Contributions

### Data Reconciliation
- Analyzed patient scheduling data across multiple sources
- Identified data quality issues and inconsistencies
- Established data validation rules

### Weighted Scoring Framework
- Designed scoring algorithm considering multiple factors
- Patient preferences and constraints
- Provider availability optimization
- Resource utilization efficiency

### Technical Implementation
- **Python**: Data analysis and prototype development
- **Snowflake**: Large-scale data querying and analysis
- **GraphQL**: API integration for data access
- **Data Analysis**: Statistical analysis and pattern recognition

## Impact

- Prototyped foundation for AI-driven patient scheduling
- Demonstrated feasibility of weighted scoring approach
- Identified key data points for scheduling optimization
- Created framework for future production implementation

## Hackathon Achievements

- Completed end-to-end prototype within hackathon timeline
- Demonstrated practical application of data analysis
- Received positive feedback from stakeholders
- Established groundwork for continued development
