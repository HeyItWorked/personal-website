## Project Overview

A secure mobile banking application for a regional bank, featuring biometric authentication, real-time transactions, and comprehensive account management. The app serves over 100,000 active users.

## Security Features

### Authentication
- **Biometric login** (Face ID / Touch ID)
- **Two-factor authentication** via SMS and email
- **Device binding** to prevent unauthorized access
- **Session management** with automatic timeout

### Data Protection
- **End-to-end encryption** for all communications
- **Certificate pinning** to prevent MITM attacks
- **Secure storage** of sensitive data using native keychains
- **Root/jailbreak detection** to protect against compromised devices

## Technical Implementation

### React Native Architecture
- Single codebase for iOS and Android
- Native modules for security-critical features
- Code splitting for faster startup
- Offline-first architecture

### Backend Services
- Microservices architecture with Node.js
- Event-driven transaction processing
- MongoDB for flexible document storage
- Redis for session management

## Challenges and Solutions

### Network Reliability
Banking apps must work reliably in areas with poor connectivity:
- Queue transactions for retry
- Optimistic UI updates
- Conflict resolution for concurrent edits

### Regulatory Compliance
Met strict banking regulations:
- Comprehensive audit logging
- Data retention policies
- Privacy compliance (GDPR)
- Regular security audits

## Results

- 4.8★ rating on App Store and Play Store
- 95% of users enable biometric authentication
- 99.99% successful transaction rate
- Zero security incidents since launch
