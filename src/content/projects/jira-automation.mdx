## Project Overview

A command-line tool that automates repetitive Jira workflows and generates actionable metrics reports. Built to streamline project management tasks and provide data-driven insights into team velocity, sprint health, and ticket lifecycle patterns.

## Key Features

### Workflow Automation
- Bulk ticket transitions (e.g., move all Done tickets to Closed)
- Automated sprint creation and assignment
- Label synchronization across projects
- Custom field updates based on rules

### Metrics & Reporting
- Sprint velocity tracking and trend analysis
- Cycle time calculation (creation → resolution)
- Workload distribution across team members
- Burndown/burnup chart data generation
- Blocker and dependency analysis

### Data Export
- CSV export for Excel analysis
- JSON output for pipeline integration
- Formatted markdown reports for standups
- Custom report templates

## Technical Implementation

### Technologies Used
- **Python 3.10+**: Core development
- **Jira REST API v3**: Issue and project data access
- **Pandas**: Data aggregation and analysis
- **Click**: CLI framework for command structure
- **Rich**: Terminal formatting and progress bars
- **python-dotenv**: Configuration management

### CLI Commands
```bash
# Transition tickets
jira-auto transition --from "In Progress" --to "Done" --project PROJ

# Generate sprint report
jira-auto report sprint --sprint "Sprint 23" --format markdown

# Export metrics
jira-auto export velocity --last 6 --output velocity.csv

# Analyze cycle time
jira-auto metrics cycle-time --project PROJ --days 30
```

### Architecture
1. **API Client**: Jira REST API wrapper with rate limiting
2. **Data Models**: Pydantic models for Jira entities
3. **Transform Layer**: Data cleaning and enrichment
4. **Analysis Engine**: Metrics calculation
5. **CLI Interface**: Click commands with Rich output

## Real-World Impact

- Reduced sprint closeout time from 30 minutes to 2 minutes
- Identified bottlenecks causing 20% longer cycle times
- Automated weekly status report generation
- Enabled data-driven sprint planning decisions

## Challenges

1. **API Rate Limiting**: Implemented exponential backoff and request batching
2. **JQL Complexity**: Built query builder for common filter patterns
3. **Data Consistency**: Handled timezone issues and custom field variations
4. **Authentication**: Supported both API tokens and OAuth flows
