## Project Overview

A comprehensive data engineering pipeline that extracts Reddit posts and comments based on keyword searches, analyzes their sentiment using VADER, and stores structured results in PostgreSQL with a Streamlit dashboard for visualization.

## Architecture

The pipeline follows a modular design with distinct stages:
1. **Ingestion**: Extract posts and comments from Reddit using PRAW
2. **Processing**: Analyze sentiment and clean text data
3. **Storage**: Store structured results in PostgreSQL
4. **Visualization**: Interactive Streamlit dashboard for insights

## Key Features

### Data Collection
- Reddit API integration via PRAW
- Keyword-based search queries
- Graceful handling of API rate limiting
- Focus on comment analysis for better accuracy

### Text Processing
- Multi-step text cleaning pipeline
- URL and markdown removal
- Noise reduction for accurate sentiment analysis

### Sentiment Analysis
- VADER sentiment scoring
- Positive, negative, neutral, and compound metrics
- Real-time analysis pipeline

### Data Storage
- PostgreSQL database with three interconnected tables
- Tracks search queries, posts, and analyzed comments
- Detailed sentiment metrics storage

## Technical Implementation

### Technologies Used
- **Python 3.9+**: Core development language
- **PRAW**: Python Reddit API Wrapper for data collection
- **VADER**: Sentiment analysis engine
- **PostgreSQL**: Relational database for structured storage
- **Pandas**: Data manipulation and processing
- **Pydantic**: Data validation and schema enforcement
- **Streamlit**: Interactive dashboard and visualization

## Challenges Overcome

1. **Data Quality**: Shifted from analyzing top posts to top comments after discovering posts yielded noisy, meaningless results
2. **API Management**: Implemented graceful handling of Reddit API rate limiting
3. **Text Cleaning**: Built robust multi-step pipeline to handle various text formats and noise

## Impact

- Built complete data engineering lifecycle from API to visualization
- Achieved accurate sentiment analysis through iterative improvement
- Created production-ready database schema for scalable storage
