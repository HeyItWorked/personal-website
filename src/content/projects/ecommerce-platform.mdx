## Project Overview

A comprehensive e-commerce platform built for a retail client looking to modernize their online presence. The platform handles thousands of daily transactions and manages real-time inventory across multiple warehouses.

## Challenges

### Real-time Inventory Management
The biggest challenge was ensuring accurate inventory counts across multiple sales channels while handling concurrent purchases. We implemented:

- **Optimistic locking** for inventory items
- **Event sourcing** to track all inventory changes
- **Redis caching** for fast inventory lookups
- **WebSocket connections** for real-time updates

### Payment Processing
Integrating multiple payment providers while maintaining PCI compliance required careful architecture:

- Tokenized payment information
- Idempotency keys for duplicate prevention
- Comprehensive audit logging
- Automated reconciliation reports

## Technical Architecture
