As a Senior Software Engineer at TechCorp Inc, I've been instrumental in modernizing our core platform infrastructure. My primary focus has been on architecting scalable solutions that can handle our growing user base while maintaining system reliability.

## Key Responsibilities

- **Architecture Design**: Led the design and implementation of event-driven microservices architecture
- **Team Leadership**: Mentored junior engineers and conducted code reviews to ensure code quality
- **Performance Optimization**: Optimized database queries and implemented caching strategies
- **DevOps**: Established CI/CD pipelines and infrastructure as code practices

## Technical Challenges

One of the most significant challenges was migrating our monolithic application to microservices without disrupting our 24/7 operations. We implemented a strangler fig pattern, gradually extracting services while maintaining backwards compatibility.
