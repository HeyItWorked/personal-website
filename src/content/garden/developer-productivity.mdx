Over the years I've developed various systems for staying productive as a developer. This note collects my current thinking on what actually works — and what doesn't.

## Environment as Code

A consistent, reproducible development environment saves countless hours. If you can't set up a new machine in under an hour, you're losing time.

<Callout type="tip" title="My Dotfiles Strategy">
  Everything lives in git: shell configs, editor settings, aliases, and install scripts. New machine setup: `git clone && ./install.sh`
</Callout>

**Key components:**
- **Dotfiles in git** — Track configurations, not just code
- **Dev containers** — Same environment everywhere (especially for team projects)
- **Makefile/scripts** — Document common tasks so you don't forget
- **Sensible defaults** — Good editor/terminal settings out of the box

## Deep Work Blocks

Coding requires sustained focus. Context switching kills productivity.

My current approach:
- **Morning blocks** (2-3 hours) for hard problems
- **Slack/email** only at 11am, 2pm, 5pm
- **Phone stays** in another room during focus time
- **Noise-cancelling headphones** — non-negotiable

<Callout type="warning">
  Multitasking is a lie. Studies show it takes 20+ minutes to regain deep focus after an interruption. Protect your attention.
</Callout>

## Knowledge Management

As developers, we're constantly learning. Without a system, knowledge leaks away.

| Approach | Pros | Cons |
|----------|------|------|
| Digital Garden (this site) | Public, linked thoughts | Takes time to maintain |
| Obsidian | Fast, local, graph view | Can become a rabbit hole |
| Plain text + git | Simple, durable | No nice UI |
| Notion | Pretty, collaborative | Slow, proprietary |

I'm currently using a hybrid: this digital garden for public notes, Obsidian for private thoughts, and a `notes` repo for quick snippets.

## Automation Rules

Automate anything you do more than twice:

- **Shell aliases** — `g` for `git`, `k` for `kubectl`, etc.
- **Scripts** — Repetitive tasks become one command
- **CI/CD** — Never manually deploy or run tests
- **Templates** — Boilerplate for new projects

<Callout type="info">
  Time spent improving your tools pays dividends. A 5-minute task done 10 times is almost an hour. Automate it.
</Callout>

## Tooling Investment

Learn your tools deeply:

- **Editor** — Know the shortcuts, plugins, and workflows
- **Shell** — Master bash/zsh and scripting
- **Git** — Beyond commit/push: rebase, bisect, reflog
- **Hardware** — Good monitor, keyboard, chair pay for themselves

## What I'm Still Figuring Out

- **Time blocking vs flexible schedules** — Rigidity helps focus but kills creativity
- **Note-taking systems** — Finding the right balance between structure and speed
- **Learning vs doing** — How much time to spend on tutorials vs building
- **Context switching** — Managing multiple projects without losing state
