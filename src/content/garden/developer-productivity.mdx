Over the years I've developed various systems for staying productive as a developer. This note collects my current thinking on what works.

## Environment Matters

A consistent, reproducible development environment saves countless hours:

- **Dotfiles in git** - Track your configurations
- **Dev containers** - Same environment everywhere
- **Makefile/scripts** - Document common tasks
- **Good defaults** - Sensible editor/terminal settings

## Deep Work Blocks

Coding requires sustained focus. I protect deep work time aggressively:

- Morning blocks for hard problems
- Slack/email checking at set times
- Phone in another room
- Noise-cancelling headphones

## Knowledge Management

As developers, we're constantly learning:

- Keep notes on what you learn
- Build a personal wiki/digital garden
- Document decisions and their context
- Write about complex topics (teaching solidifies learning)

## Automation

Automate anything you do more than twice:

- Shell aliases for common commands
- Scripts for repetitive tasks
- CI/CD for testing and deployment
- Templates for boilerplate

## Tooling Investment

Time spent improving your tools pays dividends:

- Learn your editor deeply
- Master your shell
- Invest in good hardware
- Curate your development environment

## Still Exploring

- Time blocking vs flexible schedules
- Note-taking systems (Obsidian, Notion, plain text)
- How to balance learning vs doing
- Managing context switching between projects
