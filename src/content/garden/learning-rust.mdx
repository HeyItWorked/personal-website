Starting my Rust learning journey in 2025. These are living notes that I'll refine as I go from complete beginner to building real systems.

## Why Rust?

I chose Rust for a few specific reasons:

- **Memory safety without GC** — Predictable performance for systems programming
- **Zero-cost abstractions** — High-level ergonomics, low-level control
- **WASM support** — Run in browsers at near-native speed
- **Error messages** — The compiler actually teaches you

<Callout type="info">
  My goal isn't to become a Rust expert overnight. It's to understand systems programming concepts deeply enough to write efficient, safe code.
</Callout>

## Resources I'm Using

## Initial Impressions

The borrow checker is both frustrating and enlightening. It forces you to think about ownership and lifetimes in ways other languages don't.

<Callout type="warning" title="Expect Frustration">
  The first week is rough. You'll fight the compiler constantly. Then something clicks and you start *thinking* in ownership terms.
</Callout>

## Current Sticking Points

| Concept | Status | Notes |
|---------|--------|-------|
| Lifetime annotations | 🟡 Confused | Still wrestling with `'a` syntax |
| String vs `&str` | 🟡 Getting it | Use `String` for owned data, `&str` for borrowed |
| Modules/crates | 🔴 Stuck | The module system is complex |

<Callout type="tip" title="String vs &str Rule of Thumb">
  Use `String` when you need ownership (heap-allocated, growable). Use `&str` for string slices/views into existing data.
</Callout>

## Project: DNS Server

I'm not just reading — I'm building. My first real project is a DNS server from scratch.

**What it does:**
- Parses DNS packets byte-by-byte
- Handles UDP sockets
- Implements recursive resolution

<Callout type="info">
  Building a DNS server taught me more about binary protocols than any tutorial could. See the project at [github.com/HeyItWorked/dns-server-rust](https://github.com/HeyItWorked/dns-server-rust)
</Callout>

## Next Steps

- [x] Build a small CLI tool (done: word counter)
- [x] Try WebAssembly compilation (done: basic setup)
- [ ] Contribute to an open source project
- [ ] Build something with async/await (Tokio)
