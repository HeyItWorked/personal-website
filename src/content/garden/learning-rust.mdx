Starting my Rust learning journey. These are rough notes that I'll refine as I go.

## Why Rust?

- Memory safety without garbage collection
- Zero-cost abstractions
- Great tooling (cargo, rust-analyzer)
- Growing ecosystem (WebAssembly, systems programming)
- Helpful compiler error messages

## Initial Impressions

The borrow checker is both frustrating and enlightening. It forces you to think about ownership and lifetimes in ways other languages don't.

Resources I'm using:
- The Rust Book (official)
- Rust by Example
- exercism.org Rust track

## Current Sticking Points

- Lifetime annotations still confusing
- String vs &str when to use which
- Modules and crate structure

## Next Steps

- Build a small CLI tool
- Try WebAssembly compilation
- Contribute to an open source project
